# DSA
Starting basic DSA topics to get hands on with problem-solving

Kick start Data Structure with

-Array:
1. Reverse the Array: Given an array arr[], the task is to reverse the array. Reversing an array means rearranging the elements such that the first element becomes the last, the second element becomes second last and so on.


2. Maximum and minimum of an array: Given an array of size N. The task is to find the maximum and the minimum element of the array using the minimum number of comparisons.

3. Kth Smallest: Given an array arr[] and an integer k where k is smaller than the size of the array, the task is to find the kth smallest element in the given array.

  Follow up: Don't solve it using the inbuilt sort function.
