Starting basic DSA topics to get hands on with problem-solving

Kick start Data Structure with

-Array:
1. Reverse the Array: Given an array arr[], the task is to reverse the array. Reversing an array means rearranging the elements such that the first element becomes the last, the second element becomes second last and so on.


2. Maximum and minimum of an array: Given an array of size N. The task is to find the maximum and the minimum element of the array using the minimum number of comparisons.

3. Kth Smallest: Given an array arr[] and an integer k where k is smaller than the size of the array, the task is to find the kth smallest element in the given array.
Follow up: Don't solve it using the inbuilt sort function.

4. Sort 0s, 1s and 2s: Given an array arr[] containing only 0s, 1s, and 2s. Sort the array in ascending order.

5. Move all negative numbers to beginning and positive to end with constant extra space: An array contains both positive and negative numbers in random order. Rearrange the array elements so that all negative numbers appear before all positive numbers.

6. Union of Arrays with Duplicates: Given two arrays a[] and b[], the task is to find the number of elements in the union between these two arrays.The Union of the two arrays can be defined as the set containing distinct elements from both arrays. If there are repetitions, then only one element occurrence should be there in the union.

7. Rotate Array by One: Given an array arr, rotate the array by one position in clockwise direction.
